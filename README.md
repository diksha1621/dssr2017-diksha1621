## As a studet I want to learn R and MATLAb so that I can use both of these to analyse my bioinformatics data ##. 


## I am basically working as a bioinformatician in Austen Ganley's lab. We are working in a team of 7-8 people to understand the rDNA and more importantly its role in cancer progression, which would require me work with paired tumor-normal datasets from patients. And most of the time I have to analyse this data with respect to mutations, changes occuring during cancer and comparing them with non-cancer samples. For which I really need to use R codes(to handle these large datasets). And thats the reason I am here attending this session.
